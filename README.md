# HowTo 
**HowTo backup your 12, 18 or 24 word SEED PHRASE using the CipherTag and 12 Word Plates.<br/>
Both products can be used to permanently backup your BIP0039 and/or SLIP0039 seed phrases**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**BIP0039** stands for Bitcoin Improvement Protocol 0039(BIP0039).  It describes the implementation of mnemonics(replacing 0’s and 1’s with a group of easy to remember words) for generation of deterministic cryptocurrency wallets.
<br/>
<br/>
**SLIP0039** stands for SatoshiLabs Improvement Protocols.  It describes a standard and implementation of Shamir’s secret sharing(SSS).  Sharmir’s secret sharing splits a master secret(seed phrase) into separate unique parts that can be distributed amount several participants.  A specific minimum number of parts are required to be able to reconstruct the master secret(seed phrase).  Knowledge of fewer than the required number of parts does not leak the information about the master secret(seed phrase).
<br/>
<br/>
The majority of crypto wallets available today follow the **BIP0039** standard wordlist.  It describes the implementation of mnemonics(replacing 0’s and 1’s with a group of easy to remember words) for generation of deterministic cryptocurrency wallets.<br/>
The BIP0039 wordlist can be found on this link:<br/>

## Description - 3x11
There is a grid of 3 rows of 11 columns; "3x11" name.  There are 6 of these grids on the CipherTag™ and 12 girds on theCipherSechs™ 12 Word Plates.
These are used to permanently store each word of your seed phrase using the process below.  To mark the seeds you can use a manual or an automatic center punch.

###### CipherTag 3x11

<br/>
###### 1st Letter
The first vertical column translates to the numbers ranging from 0-2 from the word list that consists of 4 digits. The first numeric digit of the mnemonic from the word list is counting down from 0 to 1 to 2.  This vertical column translates the first number of the word list consisting of 4 digits.<br/>
**This is the 1st digit corresponding to the 1st letter of the seed word.**
<br/><br/>
###### 2nd Letter
The row below, and the next series of dots from left-to right (columns 2-11)translate to the numbers ranging from 0-9 from the word list consisting of 4 digits.<br/>
**This is the 2nd digit corresponding to the 2nd letter of the seed word.**
<br/><br/>
###### 3rd Letter
The row below, and the next series of dots from left-to right (columns 2-11)translate to the numbers ranging from 0-9 from the word list consisting of 4 digits.<br/> 
**This is the 3rd digit corresponding to the 3rd letter of the seed word.**
<br/><br/>
###### 4th Letter
The row below, and the next series of dots from left-to right (columns 2-11)translate to the numbers ranging from 0-9 from the word list consisting of 4 digits.<br/>
**This is the 4th digit corresponding to the 4th letter of the seed word.**

###### An example of a completed backup on the CipherTag

## Description - 3x11 OPS

As mentioned above:
There is a grid of 3 rows of 11(ergo 3x11) columns.  There are 6 of these grids on the CipherTag™ and 12 grids on the CipherSechs™ 12 Word Plates.
These are used to permanently mark your seed phrase using the process below.  To mark the seeds you can use a manual or an automatic center punch.
<br/><br/>
However.. this method introduces "OpSec"; operational security - a security methodology to prevent sensitive information from getting into the wrong hands.
Instead of having the 4 digit number for each seed word punched on a displayed number on the 3x11 grid, we have opted to allow the owner to obfuscate the process/methodology of **how** the seed word is stored. The 3x11 grid of circles are not marked and are purposefully left blank.
<br/><br/>
###### CipherTag 3x11 OPS
![RENDER - Tag_3x11OPS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97874862/149795891-a9bb6a87-a526-4ef6-969c-fc5ca4422c16.png)

###### CipherSechs 3x11 OPS 12 Word Plate

![RENDER - Plate_3x11OPSa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97874862/149796749-d8183334-6476-4d9a-8d5f-4b48c856548e.png)
<br/><br/><br/>
## Usage
In this case, an owner of the seed word may decide to shift the **cipher**; ie the punched/marked holes to the right 'x' amount of spaces, thereby obfuscating the actual seed word stored.  Only the owner of the wallet would know the correct 'x' amount to shift the pattern back to - to reference the correct seed word.  The cipher can be shifted by the **whole** word, or via **one digit**.<br/>
See below photo for an illustrative explanation.
<br/>
###### Cipher shifted incrementally by WHOLE word

###### Cipher shifted incrementally by DIGIT only
