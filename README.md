**HowTo** backup your 12, 18 or 24 word SEED PHRASE using the CipherTag and 6 Word Plates.<br/>
Both products can be used to permanently backup your BIP039 and/or SLIP0039 seed phrases**

BIP39 stands for Bitcoin Improvement Protocol 0039(BIP0039).  It describes the implementation of mnemonics(replacing 0’s and 1’s with a group of easy to remember words) for generation of deterministic cryptocurrency wallets.

SLIP39 stands for SatoshiLabs Improvement Protocols.  It describes a standard and implementation of Shamir’s secret sharing(SSS).  Sharmir’s secret sharing splits a master secret(seed phrase) into separate unique parts that can be distributed amount several participants.  A specific minimum number of parts are required to be able to reconstruct the master secret(seed phrase).  Knowledge of fewer than the required number of parts does not leak the information about the master secret(seed phrase).

The majority of crypto wallets available today follow the BIP0039 standard wordlist.  It describes the implementation of mnemonics(replacing 0’s and 1’s with a group of easy to remember words) for generation of deterministic cryptocurrency wallets.<br/>

**INSTRUCTIONS AND USAGE : 3x11**

There is a grid of 3 rows of 11(3x11) columns.  There are 6 of these grids on the CipherTag™/CipherSechs™ 6 Word Plates.
These are used to permanently mark your seed phrase using the process below.

Refer to Figure 1.

The first vertical column translates to the numbers ranging from 0-2 from the word list that consists of 4 digits. The first numeric digit of the mnemonic from the word list is counting down from 0 to 1 to 2.  This vertical column translates the first number of the word list consisting of 4 digits.<br/>
**This is the 1st digit.**

The row below, and the next series of dots from left-to right (columns 2-11)translate to the numbers ranging from 0-9 from the word list consisting of 4 digits.<br/>
**This is the 2nd digit.**

The row below, and the next series of dots from left-to right (columns 2-11)translate to the numbers ranging from 0-9 from the word list consisting of 4 digits.<br/> 
**This is the 3rd digit.**

The row below, and the next series of dots from left-to right (columns 2-11)translate to the numbers ranging from 0-9 from the word list consisting of 4 digits.<br/>
**This is the 4th digit.**
